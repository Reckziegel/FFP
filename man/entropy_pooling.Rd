\usage{
entropy_pooling(p, A = NULL, b = NULL, Aeq, beq)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{A vector of prior probabilities}

\item{A}{The linear inequality constraint (left-hand side)}

\item{b}{The linear inequality constraint (right-hand side)}

\item{Aeq}{The linear equality constraint (left-hand side)}

\item{beq}{The linear equality constraint (right-hand side)}
}
\value{
A vector of posterior probabilities.
}
\description{
This function solves the entropy minimization problem with equality and inequality
constraints. The solution is a vector of posterior probabilities that distorts
the least the prior (equal-weights probabilities), given the constraints.
